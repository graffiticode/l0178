// A keyword names one OPERATION. That is usually the (endpoint, action) PAIR —
// `items-get` is `itembank/items` + `get` — but where the API branches on a field VALUE
// it is (endpoint, action, discriminant): `sessions` + `set` is two operations selected
// by `data_format`, and they get a keyword each. See DISCRIMINATED OPERATIONS below. Modelling the pair as a single keyword
// rather than as two properties is what makes the scoping work: a field's legality
// depends on the pair, not on the endpoint alone (`itembank/items` under `get` takes
// `references`/`limit`/`next`; under `set` it takes an `items` array of definitions —
// disjoint sets). It also sidesteps the base lexicon, where bare `get` and `set` are
// already taken by L0000.
//
// See spec/coverage.md for the whole surface this is a slice of, and for the rules
// that fixed this design: `duplicate` is a path not an action; the action verb does
// not imply read-vs-write; async is a mode carried by 13 individual blocks rather
// than a path prefix; and a block may carry variants selected by a field VALUE
// (`sessions` + `set` on `data_format`) rather than by a third key axis.

  // reasons:
  //   - `data` is `array[object]` in one and `array[string]` in the other. A single
  //     `data` keyword meaning two different types is exactly the hazard the per-block
  //     field scoping exists to prevent.
  //   - variant machinery would sit in every block's validation path to serve ONE
  //     documented case — the same objection that kept a third registry axis out (C3).
  //   - the discriminant becomes unmissable and uncontradictable: the block chooses it,
  //     `fixed` emits it, and the author cannot omit it or mismatch it to the payload.
  // Both are UNVERIFIED — they write sessions, and there was no cheap way to exercise
