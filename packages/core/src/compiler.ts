// L0178 — Learnosity Data API cookbook.
//
// Uniform surface (derived from vocab.ts): every PROPERTY is an arity-2 kebab
// function; a BLOCK is arity-2 and folds its [list] into a request; paging policy
// values are UPPERCASE TAG tokens. Everything except the block and the paging policy
// is optional.
//
// Property functions are deliberately DUMB — they collect, they do not validate. A
// field's legality and type depend on the (endpoint, action) block it lands in, and a
// property function cannot see that context. All validation therefore happens at the
// fold, where the block is known. This is the same discipline L0177 arrived at, and
// for the same reason: a field validated in isolation is a field validated against
// the wrong schema.
//
// Each accepted field records its exact Learnosity path in `paths`, so the recipe
// never infers one from a kebab name (`include-items` is `include.items`, but
// `item-pool-id` is `item_pool_id`).
//
// NOTE ON FAIL-OPEN: L0177 drops unknown fields because the Author API silently
// ignores them. The Data API reports errors instead, so the reason here is different
// and narrower — an unknown field is a design mistake worth naming, not a silent
// enforcement failure. Do not import L0177's differential-verification reasoning.
