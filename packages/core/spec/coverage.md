# L0178 coverage ledger — the Learnosity Data API surface

This is the **denominator**. L0177's credibility rests on being able to say every emitted path
was cross-checked against the published reference, and that sentence is only available against a
known total. This file is that total, so each slice L0178 builds can report progress against it.

It is a map, not knowledge. Everything in the TABLE below is read off Learnosity's published
reference — see "Provenance" — and **none of the table is verified**. It records the shape of the
API, not how the API behaves.

That distinction has already paid out. `itembank/items` + `get` was afterwards exercised against
the live demo Item bank, and the run produced two facts the reference does not state: a `limit`
above the documented maximum is **silently clamped** rather than rejected, and the response
envelope carries a `meta.versions` object. Both are in `instructions.md` marked `[verified]`. The
un-written tricks that make this dialect worth having are, by definition, absent from the
documentation — this map tells you where to go looking, never what you will find there.

**Coverage against this denominator: 5 of 57 blocks built**, all verified live:

| Block | Shape | Verified against |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `itembank/items` + `get` | paged, ends on an absent cursor | public demo bank |
| `sessions/responses` + `get` | paged, ends on an empty page | public demo bank |
| `jobs` + `get` | not paged; the async polling channel | private consumer, sandbox 386 |
| `itembank/offlinepackage` + `get` | **async** — returns a job reference | private consumer, sandbox 386 |
| `itembank/items` + `set` | **writes**; replaces rather than merges | private consumer, sandbox 386 |

Each was chosen to DISAGREE with what was already modelled, and each disagreement paid: the two
paged blocks end their loops by opposite rules (C15); the documented `status` default on `jobs`
turned out not to exist, so following the reference breaks a polling loop (C16); `set`
replaces rather than merges, which the reference never states (C18); and the async envelope
genuinely differs per endpoint rather than one form being a doc error (C17). The register
now stands at 18 entries with none open — the last, C5, closed on a measurement showing the
API answers plain HTTP with a 301 rather than the documented 403 (C5).

**Writes are never sent to the public demo account** — it is shared and writes persist. The
private consumer covers what the demo cannot, and writes land in sandbox bank 386.

## Totals

| | |
| :-- | --: |
| Endpoints | **40** |
| `(endpoint, action)` blocks | **57** |
| Documented parameters (incl. nested) | ~576 |
| Blocks returning a paged result | 13 |
| Blocks that create an async job | 13 |

Actions are exactly four: `get` (28), `set` (20), `update` (8), `delete` (1).

## What the map settled

**1. `duplicate` is a PATH, not an action.** `itembank/items/duplicate` takes action `set`. The
action vocabulary is closed at four verbs, which keeps the registry's second axis small.

**2. The action name does NOT tell you whether an operation writes.** `jobs/sessions/scores/subscores`
takes action **`get`** and triggers a subscore *recalculation* job. Any read/write classification
must come from the operation's own description, never from its verb. This is why the ledger has no
R/W column: a derived one would have been wrong and would have looked authoritative.

**3. `(endpoint, action)` is the right key, but a block may carry VARIANTS.** Field sets are
genuinely disjoint across actions on one endpoint — `itembank/items` under `get` takes
`references`/`limit`/`next`/`status`/`tags`/`include`, under `set` an `items` array of definitions.
That is why the key needs two levels. The one apparent counter-example resolved cleanly: `sessions`
+ `set` is a **discriminated union on `data_format`**, not a third axis —

| `data_format` | `data` | Also takes | Article |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `failed_submission` | `array[string]` of base64 session blobs | `ignore_response_revisions` | `26076336091933` |
| `from_template` | `array[object]` of sessions + responses | — | `26076278679069` |

Same endpoint, same action, disjoint fields, selected by a field *value*. Model it as a variant
inside the `(sessions, set)` block keyed on `data_format`. **The registry stays two-level.**

**4. Async is a MODE, not a second head — and `jobs` is the shared polling channel.** 13 blocks
create a long-running job and return `{ data: { job_reference } }`, to be polled with `jobs` +
`get`. They are spread across `itembank/*`, `sessions/*`, `reports/*` and `jobs/*` — async is a
property of the individual operation, not of a path prefix, so it cannot be modelled by giving
`jobs/*` its own head. Two of the 13 are `get` blocks (`itembank/offlinepackage`,
`jobs/sessions/scores/subscores`), both verified by reading their response sections.

**5. Paging and async are disjoint concerns.** 13 blocks page, 13 create jobs, and no block does
both. A read either returns a page (with `meta.next`) or a `job_reference`, never both.

## The scope boundary — SETTLED: the data/UX axis

**L0178 covers all 57 blocks.** The dividing line across this family of dialects is not which
vendor API a call belongs to. It is:

> **"I want the data" vs "I want a UX of the data."** They are two views of the same underlying
> thing, and each view is a dialect.

**L0178 is the DATA plane for the whole family.** Every other Learnosity dialect is a UX plane
over some slice of the same data:

| Underlying data | Data view | UX view |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Item bank | **L0178** `itembank/*` | **L0177** (Author API) |
| Assessment results | **L0178** `sessions/*`, `reports/*` | a Reports dialect, unbuilt |
| Delivery | **L0178** `sessions/*` | an Items/Assess dialect, unbuilt |
| Grading | **L0178** `sessions/responses/scores/grading` | a Grading dialect, unbuilt |

The axis and the per-API split happen to coincide across this surface — nothing in the Data API's
57 blocks renders anything, and nothing in the Reports API's 89 articles returns raw records — but
the AXIS is the rule. Where the two ever disagree, follow the axis.

**Why this and not a per-goal split.** Moving the 19 `sessions/*` + `reports/*` blocks to a
Reports dialect looked attractive (a user asking for learner scores does not care which API
answers). It fails on three counts the ledger makes measurable:

- It splits the paged surface nearly in half — 7 of 13 paged blocks are `itembank/*`, **6 are
  `sessions/*`** — so the `meta.next`/`meta.records` discipline, the one thing here verified
  against a live consumer, would have to be taught in two prompts that then age independently.
- It splits the async mode: 4 `itembank`, 4 `jobs`, **5 `sessions`**.
- **It breaks the polling story outright.** A `sessions` write returns a `job_reference` whose
  only completion path is `jobs` + `get`. Split them and the Reports dialect cannot describe how
  to finish its own writes. The boundary is not even clean at the path level —
  `jobs/sessions/metadata`, `jobs/sessions/statuses`, `jobs/reports/datasets` straddle it.

And it does not recur. Session data is wanted by delivery, reporting AND grading; a goal-based cut
re-opens the same argument with every new dialect, while the axis answers it once.

**Two seams, stated rather than papered over.**

- L0178 is the data **access** plane, not a retrieval plane: it writes as well as reads. So the
  item bank has a UX write path (L0177's editor) and a data write path (L0178's `set`). That is
  not a contradiction; it is what "two views of the same data" means.
- **L0176 sits off the axis.** It composes item CONTENT — it is neither a data view nor a UX view
  of existing data, it makes the payload that `itembank/items` + `set` transports. The chain is
  L0176 composes → L0178 moves → L0177 renders for humans. Worth stating, because "authors
  Learnosity items" and "writes items to the bank" sound like one job and are not.

**Naming hazard.** Data API `reports/datasets` is NOT the Reports API. Two different things
sharing a word; L0178 owns the former and will never own the latter.

**Consequence for priorities.** Because this is the single data plane, partial coverage leaves
every future UX dialect with holes it cannot fill — a Reports dialect would punt score extraction
here and find it unbuilt. Completeness over the 57 matters more than it would for a leaf dialect.

## Provenance

Extracted from Learnosity's Zendesk help centre on 2026-08-13 — 56 Data API articles of 2,166
total. `help.learnosity.com` 403s WebFetch and curl, but the Zendesk API underneath is open:

```bash
curl -s "https://help.learnosity.com/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles.json?per_page=100&page=N"
curl -s "https://help.learnosity.com/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/<id>.json"   # -> .article.body
```

Endpoint articles are titled `<Endpoint> - Endpoints - Data API`; error codes are
`<HTTP code> - Troubleshooting - Data API`. The `Source article` column below is the Zendesk id,
so any row can be re-read at its source. Parameter counts include nested properties and are for
SIZING ONLY — do not treat them as a field list.

Two extraction traps, both hit and fixed, both worth knowing before re-deriving this table: several
articles embed an `Example Response:` *inside* a parameter description, which truncates the
parameter section early (it put `itembank/questions get` at 6 params instead of 16); and an action
block's text runs on into the next operation's prose, so scanning a whole block for `job_reference`
marks every operation in a mixed article as async. Bound the parameter section on the
`Responses`/`Response example` header, and the async check on a short window after it.
